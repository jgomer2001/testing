# User Management with SCIM

SCIM is a specification designed to reduce the complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and the patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP in a platform-neutral fashion. The aim of SCIM is achieving interoperability, security, and scalability in the context of identity management.

You can think of **SCIM** merely as a **REST API** with endpoints exposing **CRUD** functionality (create, retrieve update, and delete).

For your reference, current version of the specification (2.0) is governed by the following documents: [RFC 7642](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7642), [RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643), and [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

## API protection

It's clear that this API must not be anonymously accessed, however the SCIM standard does not define a specific mechanism to prevent unauthorized requests to endpoints. In this regard there are just a few guidelines in section 2 of [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644) concerned with authentication and authorization. 

Gluu Server CE allows you to protect your endpoints with [UMA](scim-uma.md) (a profile of [OAuth 2.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)). This is a safe and standardized approach for controling access to web resources. For SCIM protection, we **strongly recommend** its usage. 

Alternatively, for testing purposes (as well as learning) you can temporarily enable the test mode that uses a "Bearer token" approach. In test mode most complexity is taken out of the way so it serves as a quick and easy way to start interacting with your service.

In the next section, we will work using test mode. The topic of UMA will be explored later on.

## Test mode

!!! Warning
    Test mode is a weak security approach to protect your service. The way this feature operates in Gluu Server can change in future releases.

To interact with the service in test mode, you will have to:

* Activate test mode via oxTrust
* Create an OpenId client
* Request an access token to token endpoint
* Extract the token from response
* Send requests to SCIM endpoints passing the token
* Re-obtain a new access token for subsequent requests if needed

So let's elaborate on those steps.

**Important notes:**

* Learn how to check **Gluu Server logs**. These files usually reveal the source of problems when things are going wrong: SCIM service implementation resides in oxTrust so that's the first place to look at when in trouble. This file is located at `/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs/oxtrust.log`. Authorization issues (access tokens problems, for instance) are on the side of oxAuth (the authorization server), the corresponding log is at `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/oxauth.log`. Set the logging level for both applications to **TRACE** while trying to spot the source of errors, see the (log management)[..\operation/logs.md] page for more information.

* If you already have some acquaintance with Gluu's SCIM service, please glance at [below?? what's new]() so you can contrast the current approach employed in test mode with the older one (3.0.2 and earlier).

* If you are familiar to the Java programming language, you can skip the steps listed above and simply use the [below??](SCIM-Client): a Java library  developed by Gluu. Those steps are already implemented in the library so usage of the service is more transparent and pleasant.


### Activate test mode

To enable test mode, do the following:

* Login to the oxTrust GUI

* Go to `Configuration` > `Organization Configuration` and choose "enabled" for the SCIM support property

![enable scim](../img/scim/enable-scim.png)

* Navigate to `Configuration` > `JSON Configuration` > `OxTrust Configuration`, then scroll down and set the `scimTestMode` property to true.

* Click the Save Configuration button at the bottom.

You can verify the current authentication scheme by querying the `ServiceProviderConfig` endpoint:

![image](../img/scim/scim-test-mode-config.png)

To exit test mode, just set `scimTestMode` back to `false` and then click the `Save Configuration` button.
 

### Create an OpenId client

In this step we will create an OpenId Connect client that will allow us to request valid access tokens to interact with the service.

Basically, there are two ways of creating a client. One consists of issuing a HTTP POST with some Json content payload to the already existing client registration endpoint of your Gluu Server and parsing the received response. Another, more end-user oriented is via oxTrust.

If you love coding and have enough time you can take the first approach (interacting with the client registration endpoint). You can locate the endpoint URL by visiting `https://<your-gluu-host>/.well-known/openid-configuration` and locating the property `registration_endpoint`. To know what values you may have to pass in Json content please refer to section 3 of the OpenID Connect [Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html).

The more pleasant second alternative is using the Gluu server administration web interface. Just follow the steps:

* Login to `https://<your-gluu-host>/identity` using your admin credentials

* Go to `OpenId connect` > `Clients` and click the **Add client** button

* Fill out the form using the following values. As you will see most default values are OK:

  * Client Name: SCIM-Client. You may enter a different name
  * Client secret: Think of it as a password. Choose something safe but comfortable for your testing exercise 
  * Application type: Native
  * Persist Client Authorizations: true
  * Subject type: pairwise
  * Authentication method for the Token Endpoint: client_secret_basic
  * Require Auth Time: false
  * Logout Session Required: false
  * Include Claims In Id Token: false
  * Client Secret Expires: Choose a future date (one week ahead is fine)

* Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Add Scope" button, type openid in the text field, and press search. Select the row whose "display name" is **openid**, and click OK

* Repeat the previous step to add the **permission** scope

* Click the "Add Response Types" button. In the list choose **token** and click OK

* Click the "Add Grant Type" button, then select **client_credentials**

* At the bottom press the "Add" button to finish creating your OpenId client.

### Request an access token to token endpoint

!!! Note: This section requires basic knowledge of HTTP at programming or scripting (eg. bash) level.

The **client_credentials** grant chosen in the previous step allows us to obtain a token very easily: we just need to make a POST to the token endpoint of the authorization server (Gluu server) passing the recently-created client credentials. Just do the following:

* Locate the token endpoint of Gluu server: visit `https://<your-gluu-host>/.well-known/openid-configuration` and search the property labeled **token_endpoint**

* Create a text string to encode the credentials of your client. Here you have an algorithm to do so:

  * Let authUsername be the name of the client
  * Let authPassword be the client secret
  * Create a new string concatenating `authUsername`, the colon (:) character, and `authPassword` in that exact order
  * Obtain the underlying array of bytes for the string created. Use *utf-8* if you need to supply an encoding to transform the string to bytes
  * Create a base64-encoded string representation of the array of bytes (most programming languages feature this functionality out of the box)
  * Create a new string concatenating the word "Basic" (do not include quotes), a space, and the string created in previous step. This is the resulting encoded credentials 
  
* Submit a HTTPs POST to the token endpoint using the following data:

  * Authorization header. As value use the encoded credentials
  * Content-Type header. As value use *application/x-www-form-urlencoded*
  * grant_type parameter. Use *client_credentials* 

Here is an example:
```
     POST /oxauth/restv1/token HTTP/1.1
     Host: your.host.com
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     grant_type=client_credentials
```

In `curl` jargon, you may issue a command like this to achieve the same effect:

```
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Authorization: Basic ...' 
       -d grant_type=client_credentials https://<host-name>/oxauth/restv1/token
```

If you have problems creating your request, see section 4.4.2 of [OAuth 2.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for a deeper insight.

### Extract token from response

Once the POST is executed you will get a response from server in Json format. Validate you are receiving a successful response (HTTP code 200). If something went wrong (malformed request), you will see a bad request error (HTTP code 400).

The following is an example of a successful response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
	"access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
	"token_type":"Bearer",
	"expires_in":3600
}
```

From the response extract the so called **access token**.

### Send requests to SCIM endpoints

Now you can start interacting with your service!. 

To understand the protocol, that is, the endpoints available in the service and the information those endpoints accept as input and return as output, you may like to glance at the [protocol spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644). However, to make it easier for you, we have compiled some representative examples of CRUD with SCIM (creation, retrieval, update and delete) in the section [Raw of HTTP requests](?? below).

By now, let's start with a basic query: say we need to find the users whose userName contains the sequence of letters "mi". 

We need to know:

* The SCIM endpoint for user retrieval, which is `https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users` in Gluu Server 3.1.0

* How to write a filter for a search. In this case is fairly easy, the filter we need is `filter=userName co "mi"` (`co` stands for *contains*). To learn more about filters see section 3.4.2.2 of [protocol spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

* How to pass the token. Since we are using a bearer token approach, we just pass in the **Authorization** header of the request the word "Bearer" followed by a single space, and followed by the access token we already have. Do not include quotes.

Here is an example of our toy request. Note the usage of HTTP GET:

```
GET /Users?count=10&filter=userName co "mi"
   Host: your.host.com
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
```

So with `curl` it should look like this:

```
curl -G -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...access token...' -d count=10
      --data-urlencode 'filter=userName co "mi"' https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users
```

After execution you will get Json content with the results matching the criterion (at most 10 items). 

!!! Note: Always pay attention to the HTTP response code. If you are getting 401, ie. unauthorized, your token may have expired. If that's the case proceed to the next section immediately to learn how to cope with this situation.

You may consider jumping to section [Raw HTTP requests](?? below) to see more examples of how to interact with SCIM endpoints. In that section you will find more `curl` examples.

### Obtain a new access token for subsequent requests

An access token lifetime is around 5 minutes, so after a short period you will start getting a small Json response saying you are not authorized (HTTP 401) for all subsequent invocations made. This means it's time to request for a newer token.

To do this, just do the same as in the section [above](?? above Request an access token to token endpoint) where we were issued the access token for the first time. Extract the token from the response and you can continue playing around with the SCIM API endpoints.

!!! Note: To request an access token, the OpenId client acting on your behalf must be current: its password expiration also counts. Update your client expiration or create a new client if necessary. Just proceed as in previous steps.


### Differences between current (3.1.0) and older test mode

Versions 3.0.x and earlier employed a (very) long-lived OAuth2 access token to send requests to the service. As we have seen, current Gluu server uses a safer short-lived token approach in combination with an OpenId Connect client. 

The token used to be passed as an extra query parameter. We have changed this to using the Authorization header, which is a more standard and safer practice.

If you are still interested in how the older approach worked, visit the [3.0.2 page](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.0.2/admin-guide/user-scim/#using-test-mode).

In version 3.1 the root endpoint has been shortened: now your service is exposed at `https://<your-host>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/`.

## Raw HTTP requests

To lower the barrier to start with SCIM, some raw HTTP sample requests are presented in throughout this section. These requests exemplify how to do very basic CRUD on SCIM resources. While only users are being covered, you can extrapolate to groups and other kind of resources if any.

If you are a Java developer, you already have at your disposal a [library](SCIM-client section below) to interact with your SCIM endpoints so there is no need to craft requests by hand.

Examples shown here cover very little of what's possible to achieve with the SCIM REST API. For richer or advanced use cases, you may like to glance at the spec. The page [SCIM API](../api-guide/scim-api/#user-endpoint) offers a condensed and more amenable to read reference so that you can compose your requests with ease.


### Requisites

* To undertake this exercise test mode must be enabled: ensure you understand the steps shown in previous section and that you have a mechanism to automate the process of requesting access tokens since they are short lived. 
* Examples will make use of `curl` so ensure it's available in your environment. Starter knowledge of `curl` is more than enough.
* Ensure you have a text editor at hand
* It's not required, but desirable that you can inspect your LDAP contents as you proceed with the examples. If you are not comfortable issuing Open LDAP commands, a GUI client such as [Apache DS](https://directory.apache.org/studio/downloads.html) makes a very pleasant experience.

### Creating resources

Let's start creating a dummy user. Open a text editor and paste the following:

```
{
	"schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
	"userName":"ajsmith",
	"name":{
		"familyName":"Smith",
		"givenName":"Joe"
	},
	"displayName":"Average Joe"
}
```

Save it to your local disk as `input.json` and open a command line interface (you don't need to login to Gluu's chroot). Issue this command replacing with proper values between the angle brackets:

```
$ curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...access token...' -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' -H 'cache-control: no-cache' 
  -d @input.json -o output.json https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users`
```

If your gluu server is protected by a self-signed certificate (as in the default installation) add the following switch:

`--cacert /opt/gluu-server-<glu-version>/etc/certs/httpd.crt`
 
After execution open the file `output.json`. You should see a response like this (some contents have been supressed for readability):

```
{
  "id": "...",
  "meta": {
    "created": "...",
    "lastModified": "...",
    "location": "https://.../scim/v2/Users/@!..."
    "resourceType": "User"
  },
  "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User" ],
  "userName": "ajsmith",
  "name": {
    "formatted": "Joe Smith",
    "familyName": "Smith",
    "givenName": "Joe"
  },
  "displayName": "Average Joe",
  ...
}
```

This new user has been given an `id`. If possible, inspect your `ou=people` branch and find the entry whose `inum` matches the `id` given. An easier option would be to login via oxTrust and go to `Users` > `Manage People` and search "Joe" to see the recently created user.

SCIM will only allow you to create users with HTTP POST verb.

### Retrieving information of a user

One of the simplest ways to test retrieval is querying all information about a single user. Check in your LDAP the `inum` for Average Joe and do the following request with `curl` passing, as usual, your access token in the headers:

`https://<host-name>/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/v2/Users/<user-inum>`

!!! Note:
    In the Gluu Server, `inums` are long strings consisting of alphanumeric characters and typically start with @!, include these two characters as well...

As a response, you will get a JSON document with all of the attributes in the user schema and their corresponding values. For Joe, almost all of them will have a *null* or an empty array as value, as in the following:

```
{
  "id": ...,
  "externalId": null,
  "meta": {...},
  "schemas": [...],
  "userName": "ajsmith",
  "name": {
    "formatted": "Joe Smith",
    "familyName": "Smith",
    "givenName": "Joe",
    ...
  },
  "displayName": "Average Joe",
  ...
  "locale": null,
  ...
  "emails": [],
  ...
  "phoneNumbers": [],
  ...
  "addresses": []
  ...
}
```

### Retrieval with filtering

The SCIM protocol defines a standard set of parameters that can be used to filter, sort, and paginate resources in a query response (see section 3.4.3 of [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644)). Filtering capabilities are very rich and enable developers to build complex queries.

We will elaborate a bit more on the example shown in the (test mode section)[?? above]: let's create a query to return the first 2 users whose `userName` contains the sequence of letters "mi". Results should be sorted alphabetically by `givenName`.

```
$ curl -G -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...access token...'  -o output.json 
      --data-urlencode 'filter=userName co "mi"' 
      -d startIndex=1 -d count=2 -d sortBy=name.givenName
      https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users
```

As response you will have a JSON file that looks like this:

```
{
	"totalResults": 2,
	"itemsPerPage": 2,
	"startIndex": 1,
	...
	"Resources": [
		{
		...
		attributes of first user matching criteria
  		..
  		},
		{
		...
		attributes of second user matching criteria
  		..
  		}
  	]
}
```


### Updating a user

!!! Note
    SCIM spec defines two ways to update resources: HTTP PUT and PATCH. Current Gluu implementation only supports PUT (PATCH being scheduled for a future release).

Overwrite your `input.json` with the following. Replace content in angle brackets accordingly:

```
{
	"schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
	"id": <joe's-inum>,
	"userName":"ajsmith",
	"name":{
		"familyName":"Smith",
		"givenName":"Joe"
	},
	"displayName":"Joe Smith",
	"emails": [{
		"value": "jsmith@foodstuffs.eat",
		"type": "work",
		"primary": "true"
	}]	
}
```

And issue the PUT with `curl`:

```
$ curl -X PUT -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...access token...' 
       -H 'Content-Type: application/scim+json' -H 'cache-control: no-cache' 
       -d @input.json -o output.json 
       'https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users/<user-inum>'
```

!!! Note
    Surround the URL with single quotes: `inum`s contain bang characters that might be misleading to your command line interpreter.

Response (`output.json`) will show the same contents of a full retrieval.

Please verify changes were applied whether by inspecting LDAP or issuing a GET. If you have followed the steps properly, you should notice a new e-mail added and the change in `displayName` attribute.

### Deleting users

For deleting, the DELETE method of HTTP is used.

No input file is used in this case. A delete request could be the following:

```
$ curl -X DELETE -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...access token...' -H 'cache-control: no-cache' 
        'https://<host-name>/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/v2/Users/<user-inum>'
```

Use the `inum` of our dummy user, Average Joe.

Note in LDAP or by using oxTrust the absence of Joe.


## Testing with the SCIM-Client

If you code in Java, you can take advantage of the ready-to-use client library [SCIM-Client](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client) developed by Gluu. With this client, you will be able to interact with your SCIM endpoints with no need to craft requests by hand, creating clients or requesting/refreshing access tokens. You can even use the client when your endpoints are protected by UMA: all authorization steps are handled for you.

### Requisites

* Entry-level knowledge of Java is enough. Make sure you have Java Standard Edition installed. The use of maven as build tool is recommended
* Ensure you have enabled SCIM and test mode as shown [above](?? above Activate test mode).
* Add the SSL certificate of your Gluu server to the `cacerts` keystore of your local Java installation. There are lots of articles around the Web on how to import a certificate to the keystore. An utility called [Key Store Explorer](http://keystore-explorer.sourceforge.net) makes this task super-easy. If you are using a self-signed certificate, you can find it at `/opt/gluu-server-<gluu-version>/etc/certs/httpd.crt`
* Online Java-docs for SCIM-Client are available [here](https://ox.gluu.org/scim-javadocs/apidocs/index.html). You can generate java-docs locally too using maven; just run `mvn javadoc:javadoc`

### Start a simple project

Create a project in your favorite IDE, and if using maven add the following snippet to your pom.xml file:

```
<properties>
	<scim.client.version>3.1.0</scim.client.version>
</properties>
...
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>gluu</id>
    <name>Gluu repository</name>
    <url>http://ox.gluu.org/maven</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependency>
  <groupId>gluu.scim.client</groupId>
  <artifactId>SCIM-Client</artifactId>
  <version>${scim.client.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

From version 3.1.0 onwards, the SCIM-Client you use should match your Gluu version. For example, if you are running Gluu Server CE v3.1.0, you must also use SCIM-Client v3.1.0.

If you don't want to use Maven, you can download the jar file for SCIM-Client here: [https://ox.gluu.org/maven/gluu/scim/client/SCIM-Client](https://ox.gluu.org/maven/gluu/scim/client/SCIM-Client). This may require you to add other libraries (jar files dependencies) manually.

### Simple retrieval

Create a Java class using the code shown below. Replace with proper values between the angle brackets for private attributes:

```
import gluu.scim2.client.factory.ScimClientFactory;
import org.gluu.oxtrust.model.scim2.*
import org.jboss.resteasy.client.core.BaseClientResponse;
import java.util.List;

public class TestScimClient {

    private String domainURL="https://<host-name>/identity/restv1";
    private String OIDCMetadataUrl="https://<host-name>/.well-known/openid-configuration";

    private void simpleSearch() throws Exception {

        ScimClient client = ScimClientFactory.getTestClient(domainURL, OIDCMetadataUrl);
        String filter = "userName eq \"admin\"";

        BaseClientResponse<ListResponse> response = client.searchUsers(filter, 1, 1, "", "", null);
        List<Resource> results=response.getEntity().getResources();

        System.out.println("Length of results list is: " + results.size());
        User admin=(User) results.get(0);
        System.out.println("First user in the list is: " + admin.getDisplayName());

    }

}
```

The first line of method `simpleSearch` is getting an object that conforms to the `ScimClient` interface. This interface consists of a number of methods that will allow you to do all CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) you may need.

Create a main method for class `TestScimClient` and call `simpleSearch` from there. When running you will see the output of retrieving one user (admin) and see his `displayName` on the screen.

The [SCIM protected by UMA section](?? below) contains examples for [adding](?? #adding-a-user) and [deleting](?? #delete-a-user) users.  The only actual difference in coding for test mode or UMA-protected service is the way in which you initially get a `ScimClient` object instance. For test mode, just call `ScimClientFactory.getTestClient` as shown in the previous example.

### Under the hood

When running the code, in LDAP you will see one or more new entries under the clients branch (`ou=clients`). Those are new OpenId clients created by the Java client and they are employed to request short-lived tokens to access the service.
In oxTrust, you can see them easily too: navigate to `OpenId Connect` > `Clients` and notice the column `Display Name`; they are named as "SCIM-Client". 

These clients won't clutter your LDAP, they are also short-lived (one day) so they are cleaned up automatically for you.

## SCIM protected by UMA

User-managed access (UMA) is a profile of [OAuth2.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and is focused on defining standardized flows and constructs for coordinating the protection of an API or existing web resource. 

For more information on UMA please visit the corresponding [page](uma.md) in the docs - the specification can be found at [kantara website](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/rec-uma-core-v1_0_1.html).

Gluu Server CE supports UMA protection for SCIM endpoints from version 2.4.0 onwards. This functionality is built-in and does not require any special package or installation. 

!!! Note
    Gluu server 3.1.0 supports UMA 2.0 - the latest version of the standard. UMA 1.0.1 is not supported anylonger.

### Actors involved in protection

This section condenses some important aspects to be aware of when protecting your SCIM API by UMA. For instance, it's important to familiarize yourself with the different parties interacting in the process, namely a resource owner, a client, a resource server, and an authorization server.

* For the case of SCIM, the "resource" is what we are intended to protect, i.e. our database of users and groups stored in LDAP. More exactly we are interested in protecting the set of URLs that expose our data, in other words, the so-called "SCIM endpoint" - something that looks like this: `http://<your_host>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/`.

* The resource owner is normally a legal entity (e.g. your company), or someone acting on its behalf (the administrator of Gluu CE installation). The owner should be capable of granting access to protected resources.

* Requesting party is generally an end-user that seeks access to a protected resource. Only in certain use cases the requesting party and resource owner are the same person. To achieve the task, the requesting party uses a client.

* The client is usually an application capable of making requests for protected resources on the requesting party's behalf. A good example is the [SCIM-client](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client).

* The resource server hosts the resources to be protected, and thus is capable of dealing with requests for them. We can think of oxTrust as the resource server (at least as a front-end resource server because users and groups are not hosted per se by oxTrust though it has functionalities to able to access and modify data stored in LDAP)

* The authorization server is where real protection takes place. This server issues authorization data according to policies of protection set by the resource owner. In this scenario, it maps directly to oxAuth.

Now you may have a richer perspective of what the protection process entails, so let's proceed with a real setup.

### Enable protection

To make your SCIM endpoint be protected by UMA, you just have to activate a couple of features via oxTrust. Most complexity is hidden by configurations already setup in your default server installation. The [setup script](../installation-guide/setup_py.md) does a lot so that you can start quickly!

* If you haven't done so, enable SCIM from the oxTrust admin GUI. Simply Go to `Configuration` > `Organization Configuration` and choose "enabled" for the SCIM support attribute

![enable scim](../img/scim/enable-scim.png)

* Activate UMA custom script in oxTrust admin GUI: Go to `Configuration` > `Manage Custom Scripts`, and in the tab for `UMA Authorization policies` check "Enabled" at the bottom. Finally press the "Update" button.

![enable uma](../img/scim/enable_uma.png)

In the following section we will go for a deeper insight and see how configurations correlate to concepts already shown.

### Testing with the SCIM-Client

The following instructions show how to interact with the UMA-protected SCIM service using the [SCIM-Client](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client) Java library.

#### Requisites

* In the following we will use Java as programming language. Entry-level knowledge is enough. Make sure you have Java Standard Edition installed. The use of maven as build tool is recommended

* Copy the requesting party JKS file to your local machine (inside Gluu Server chroot it is located at `/install/community-edition-setup/output/scim-rp.jks`)

* Have the requesting party client ID and password at hand. You can find this info in the file `/install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last`. So try run `cat setup.properties.last | grep "scim_rp_client"`. Default password is *secret*

* Ensure you have enabled SCIM and UMA as shown [above](#enable-protection)

* Add the SSL certificate of your Gluu server to the `cacerts` keystore of your local Java installation. There are lots of articles around the Web on how to import a certificate to the keystore. An utility called [Key Store Explorer](http://keystore-explorer.sourceforge.net) makes this task super-easy. If you are using a self-signed certificate, you can find it at `/opt/gluu-server-<gluu-version>/etc/certs/httpd.crt`

* Online Java-docs for SCIM-Client are available [here](https://ox.gluu.org/scim-javadocs/apidocs/index.html). You can generate java-docs locally using maven; just run `mvn javadoc:javadoc`

#### Start a simple project

Create a project in your favorite IDE, and if using maven add the following snippet to your pom.xml file:

```
<properties>
	<scim.client.version>3.1.0</scim.client.version>
</properties>
...
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>gluu</id>
    <name>Gluu repository</name>
    <url>http://ox.gluu.org/maven</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependency>
  <groupId>gluu.scim.client</groupId>
  <artifactId>SCIM-Client</artifactId>
  <version>${scim.client.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

From version 3.1.0 onwards, the SCIM-Client you use should match your Gluu version. For example, if you are running Gluu Server CE v3.1.0, you must use SCIM-Client v3.1.0.

If you don't want to use Maven, you can download the jar file for SCIM-Client here: [https://ox.gluu.org/maven/gluu/scim/client/SCIM-Client](https://ox.gluu.org/maven/gluu/scim/client/SCIM-Client). This may require you to add other libraries (jar files dependencies) manually.

#### Simple retrieval

Create a Java class using the code shown below. Replace with proper values between the angle brackets for private attributes:

```
import gluu.scim2.client.factory.ScimClientFactory;
import org.gluu.oxtrust.model.scim2.*
import org.jboss.resteasy.client.core.BaseClientResponse;
import java.util.List;

public class TestScimClient {

    private String domain = "https://<host-name>/identity/seam/resource/restv1";
    private String umaMetaDataUrl = "https://<host-name>/.well-known/uma-configuration";
    private String umaAatClientId = "<requesting-party-client-id>";
    private String umaAatClientJksPath = "<path-to-RP-jks>/scim-rp.jks";
    private String umaAatClientJksPassword = "<jks-password>";
    private String umaAatClientKeyId = "";

    private static void simpleSearch() throws Exception {

        ScimClient client = ScimClientFactory.getClient(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);
        String filter = "userName eq \"admin\"";

        BaseClientResponse<ListResponse> response = client.searchUsers(filter, 1, 1, "", "", null);
        List<Resource> results=response.getEntity().getResources();

        System.out.println("Length of results list is: " + results.size());
        User admin=(User) results.get(0);
        System.out.println("First user in the list is: " + admin.getDisplayName());

    }
}
```

You can suply an alias from `scim-rp.jks` for `umaClientKeyId`. The first key from the file is used automatically when this value is left empty.

Create a main method for class `TestScimClient` and call `simpleSearch` from there. When running you will see the output of retrieving one user (admin) and see his `displayName` on the screen.

#### Adding a user

##### Required Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|userName | The intended username for the end-user|
|givenName| The first name of the end-user|
|familyName| The last name of the end-user|
|displayName| The name of the user, suitable for display to end-users|
|_groups_| Optional parameter if the user is added to any specific group|

There are two ways to add users:

1. [JSON String](#json-string)
2. [User Object](#user-object)


##### JSON String

A user can be added by supplying a JSON string representation with appropriate attributes. The following is an example of such a JSON written to a `properties` file:

```
json_string = {	\
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],	\
  "externalId": "12345",	\
  "userName": "newUser",	\
  "name": { "givenName": "json", "familyName": "json", "middleName": "N/A", "honorificPrefix": "", "honorificSuffix": ""},	\
  "displayName": "json json",	\
  "nickName": "json",	\
  "profileUrl": "http://www.gluu.org/",	\
  "emails": [	\
    {"value": "json@gluu.org", "type": "work", "primary": "true"},	\
    {"value": "json2@gluu.org", "type": "home", "primary": "false"}	\
  ],	\
  "addresses": [{"type": "work", "streetAddress": "621 East 6th Street Suite 200", "locality": "Austin", "region": "TX", "postalCode": "78701", "country": "US", "formatted": "621 East 6th Street Suite 200  Austin , TX 78701 US", "primary": "true"}],	\
  "phoneNumbers": [{"value": "646-345-2346", "type": "work"}],	\
  "ims": [{"value": "test_user", "type": "Skype"}],	\
  "userType": "CEO",	\
  "title": "CEO",	\
  "preferredLanguage": "en-us",	\
  "locale": "en_US",	\
  "active": "true",	\
  "password": "secret",	\
  "roles": [{"value": "Owner"}],	\
  "entitlements": [{"value": "full access"}],	\
  "x509Certificates": [{"value": "cert-12345"}]	\
}
```

Here, backslashes "\\" allow us to span the contents in several lines.

Assuming you named the file as `scim-client.properties`, the following Java code will create the new user:

```
Properties p= new Properties();
p.load(new FileInputStream("scim-client.properties"));
ScimResponse response = scim2Client.createPersonString(p.getProperty("json_string"), MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
```

##### User Object

You may also use an "*objectual*" approach to dealing with users. The following code snippet employs the class `org.gluu.oxtrust.model.scim2.User` of SCIM-Client.

```
User user = new User();

Name name = new Name();
name.setGivenName("Given Name");
name.setFamilyName("Family Name");
user.setName(name);

user.setActive(true);

user.setUserName("newUser_" +  + new Date().getTime());
user.setPassword("secret");
user.setPreferredLanguage("US_en");

List<Email> emails = new ArrayList<Email>();
Email email = new Email();
email.setPrimary(true);
email.setValue("a@b.com");
email.setDisplay("a@b.com");
email.setType(Email.Type.WORK);
email.setReference("");
emails.add(email);
user.setEmails(emails);

List<PhoneNumber> phoneNumbers = new ArrayList<PhoneNumber>();
PhoneNumber phoneNumber = new PhoneNumber();
phoneNumber.setPrimary(true);
phoneNumber.setValue("123-456-7890");
phoneNumber.setDisplay("123-456-7890");
phoneNumber.setType(PhoneNumber.Type.WORK);
phoneNumber.setReference("");
phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber);
user.setPhoneNumbers(phoneNumbers);

List<Address> addresses = new ArrayList<Address>();
Address address = new Address();
address.setPrimary(true);
address.setValue("test");
address.setDisplay("My Address");
address.setType(Address.Type.WORK);
address.setReference("");
address.setStreetAddress("My Street");
address.setLocality("My Locality");
address.setPostalCode("12345");
address.setRegion("My Region");
address.setCountry("My Country");
address.setFormatted("My Formatted Address");
addresses.add(address);
user.setAddresses(addresses);

ScimResponse response = scim2Client.createUser(user, new String[]{});
System.out.println("response HTTP code = " + response.getStatusCode());
System.out.println("response body = " + response.getResponseBodyString());
```

#### Delete a user

To delete a user only his id (the `inum` LDAP attribute) is needed. You can see the `id` of the user just created by inspecting the JSON response.

```
BaseClientResponse<User>response=client.deletePerson(id);
assertEquals(Response.Status.NO_CONTENT.getStatusCode(), response.getStatus());
```

### Using a different programming language 

Coding service interactions when SCIM endpoints are being protected by UMA is more involved than using test mode. If you are planning to code for a SCIM service protected by UMA, it is advisable to check the flow depicted in section 3 of the [UMA 2.0 spec](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/ed/oauth-uma-grant-2.0-04.html). Focus only on the interactions of client vs. another party (resource server or authorization server). In a previous (section)[?? above Actors involved in protection] we have talked about the actors involved in UMA protection; this will save you time when reading the specification.

As a guideline for your own implementation, you can take ideas from the Java class (UmaScimClient)[https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client/blob/version_3.1.0/src/main/java/gluu/scim2/client/UmaScimClient.java#L74] found in SCIM-Client. Starting  at the `authorize` method, you will see how steps in the spec flow are being followed there.

Check the metadata URL of UMA 2 to discover the oxAuth endpoint that issues tokens. Visit `https://<host-name>/.well-known/uma2-configuration`.

## Creating your own attributes by using extensions

[RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643) defines the schema for resource types in SCIM. In other words, defines structures in terms of attributes to represent users and groups as well as attribute types, mutability, cardinality, and so on. 

Despite schema covers to a good extent many attributes one might thing of, at times you will need to add your own attributes for specific needs. This is where user extensions pitch in, they allow you to create custom attributes for SCIM. To do so, you will have to:

* Add an attribute to LDAP schema
* Include the new attribute into an LDAP's objectclass such as gluuPerson or preferably, gluuCustomPerson
* Register and activate your new attribute through oxTrust GUI

Please visit this [page](attribute.md#custom-attributes) for a more detailed explanation. When registering the attribute in the admin GUI, please ensure you have set the `SCIM Attribute` parameter to `true`.

![image](../img/admin-guide/user/scim-attribute.png)

Once you submit this form, your attribute will be part of the User Extension. You can verify this by inspecting the `Schema` endpoint:

`https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Schemas/urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:gluu:2.0:User`

![image](../img/admin-guide/user/scim-custom-first.png)

In the JSON response, your new added attribute will appear.

You can learn more about SCIM Schema and the extension model by reading [RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643). Also refer to the following unit tests in SCIM-Client project for code examples in which custom attributes are involved:

* [User Extensions Object Test](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client/blob/version_3.1.0/src/test/java/gluu/scim2/client/UserExtensionsObjectTest.java)
* [User Extensions JSON Test](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client/blob/version_3.1.0/src/test/java/gluu/scim2/client/UserExtensionsJsonTest.java)

## Additional features of SCIM service

SCIM standard is concerned with two classes of resources, namely, Users and groups. However, according to spec, the service can be extended to add new resource types. Particularly, Gluu Server implementation of SCIM contains a resource type called "Fido device". 

### Fido devices

A fido device represents a user credential stored in the Gluu Server LDAP that is compliant with the [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org) standards. These devices are used as a second factor in a setting of strong authentication. Examples of fido devices are (u2f security keys)[https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.1.0/authn-guide/U2F/] and (Super Gluu devices)[https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.1.0/authn-guide/supergluu/].

Including FIDO devices as one of resource types will allow application developers querying, updating and deleting already existing (added) devices. Addition of devices do not take place through the service since this process requires direct end-user interaction, ie. device enrolling.

The following is a summary of features of a Fido Device SCIM resource:

* Schema urn: `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:FidoDevice`
* Name of resource: FidoDevice
* Endpoint URL (relative to base URL of service): `/scim/v2/FidoDevices`
* Device attributes: Attributes pertaining to this resource type are listed by visiting the URL `https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Schemas/urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:FidoDevice`. 

Currently the service supports only:
* Devices search and retrieval (via GET and POST)
* Single device update via PUT
* Single device deletion via DELETE

The following sub-section shows an example of fido device retrieval using filters.

### Example: querying enrolled Super Gluu devices
Say we are interested in having a list of supergluu devices users have enrolled and whose operating system is **iOS**. In a setting of test mode, we may issue a query like this:

```
curl -G -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...access token...' --data-urlencode 'filter=deviceData co "ios"' -d count=10 -o output.json https://<host-name>/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/v2/FidoDevices/
```

Your result list might look like:

```
{
  "totalResults": ...,
  "itemsPerPage": ...,
  "startIndex": 1,
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
  ],
  "Resources": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "meta": {...},
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:FidoDevice"],
      "userId": "...",
      ...
      "deviceData": "{\"uuid\":\"ABC123\", \"type\":\"iPhone\", \"platform\":\"ios\", \"name\":\"Someone's iPhone\", \"os_name\":\"iOS\", \"os_version\":\"10.0.1\"}",
      "displayName": ...,
    }
  ]
}
``` 

## Supporting a user registration process with SCIM

SCIM service has many use cases. One interesting and often arising is that of coding your own user registration process. With your SCIM endpoints you can build a custom application to enter users to your LDAP directory.

So far in this guide, we have already touched upon the fundamentals of SCIM in Gluu Server and shown a good amount of sample requests for manipulation of user information: creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting. However, the SCIM spec documents are definitely the key reference to build working request messages, specially [RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643), and [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

### Important considerations before starting

Here you have some useful tips before you start:

1. Choose a toolset you feel comfortable to work with. Keep in mind that you have to leverage the capabilities of your language/framework to issue complex HTTP**s** requests. Be sure that:
  * You will be able to use at least the following verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
  * You can send headers in your requests as well as reading them from the service response
  
2. If not supported natively, choose a library to facilitate Json content manipulation. As you have already noticed we have been dealing with Json for requests as well as for responses. Experience shows that being able to map from objects (or data structures) of your language to Json and viceversa helps saving hours of coding

3. Shape your data model early. List the attributes your application will operate upon and correlate with those found in the SCIM user schema. You can learn about the schema in [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644). At least, take a look at the Json formatted schema that your Gluu Server shows: visit `https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Schemas/urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`.

4. You will have to check your LDAP contents very often as you develop and run tests. You may have to delete attributes or whole entries as your application evolves. Thus, use a suitable tool for LDAP manipulation: Use oxTrust to manipulate your users' attributes or setup a LDAP GUI client to have more control.

5. Always check your logs. In (test mode)[?? above] section above you can find some guidelines in this regard.

### Summary of tasks

In this section we will summarize the tasks you need to undertake in order to code your application. We will not go into the details of any programming language or technology to build user interfaces. 

For coding an app or script that implements a user registration process, you should:

* Code authorization routines
* Code a dummy insertion routine
* Create a form to grab new users' data
* Code routines to process the HTTP POST
* Create a feedback page
* Do the adjustments in the attribute set
* Enhance your form

#### Code authorization routines

This task has to do with creating utility code that will allow you to obtain tokens (whether an "access token" for test mode or a "requesting party token" - rpt - when using UMA). This coding requires sending HTTPs requests to a few URLs.

In previous sections we covered thoroughy what needs to be done for test mode, for UMA basic [guidelines](?? above Using a different programming language) were given. Ensure you have already enabled the protection of your preference in oxTrust.

If you are unsure of how to code a particular step, take a look at the Java client. These three classes do the job:

* [AbstractScimClient](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client/blob/version_3.1.0/src/main/java/gluu/scim2/client/AbstractScimClient.java)
* [TestModeScimClient](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client/blob/version_3.1.0/src/main/java/gluu/scim2/client/UmaScimClient.java)
* [UmaScimClient](https://github.com/GluuFederation/SCIM-Client/blob/version_3.1.0/src/main/java/gluu/scim2/client/UmaScimClient.java)

To test your authorization code, use a simple retrieval request such as the example shown (here)[?? above Retrieving information of a user].

#### Code a dummy insertion routine

Use the information given in the section (Creating resources)[?? above Creating resources] to make a hard-coded POST to the user endpoint.

In summary, ascertain the following works for you:

```
POST /identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users
Host: host-name...
Accept: application/scim+json
Content-Type: application/scim+json
Authorization: Bearer ...

{
	"schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
	"userName":"ajsmith",
	"name":{
		"familyName":"Smith",
		"givenName":"Joe"
	},
	"displayName":"Average Joe"
}
``` 

#### Create a form to grab and send new users' data

Design your form according to the set of attributes you are targeting. Keep it as simple as possible and do enhancements only after you are seeing progress.

Develop the code required to take the data entered in the fields of your form and build up a Json structure the service can understand. Ensure your code creates well-formed Json in all cases. A good amount of errors stem from the fact the payload cannot be parsed by the service implementation.

#### Code routines to process the HTTP POST

Take the code used for the dummy insertion and do the arrangements to be able to post an arbitary payload. Develop the required code to parse the response given by the server. It's important to be able to read:

* The response code. Upon a successful user creation, you have to get a 201 code
* The response header. Of particular interest is the "Location" header: it contains the URL that you can use to do a full (GET) query of the recently create resource. In our case it should look like `https://<host-name>/identity/restv1/scim/v2/Users/<new-user-inum>`
* The response body. It contains the full user representation in Json format.

While testing it's important to compare that you are receiving in the body the contents you have sent. Note that you will also receive other valuable information such as the creation timestamp.

#### Create a feedback page

Create a success/failure page that shows the result of the operation based on the response received.

#### Do the adjustments in the attribute set

With your now working application, do the adjustments to include attributes that may enrich your process. A common one could be `status`. This attribute (that maps to LDAP attribute `gluuStatus`) determines whether your created user is active or not. 

#### Enhance your form

Polish your form and add mechanism to prevent abuse - a malicious user may end up creating lots of dummy entries -. Add validations, captchas, etc. that may control indiscriminate submissions.
